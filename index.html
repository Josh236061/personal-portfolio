            <p>

                <br> Name, Where I am from, Family, and Current Location: My name is Josh Thomas, I am the last of three boys of my parents, I have three nieces, and I am from Houston, TX. <br><br>


                Current Job: I work as an I.T. Manager and have also worked a few Datacenter contracts over the last year or so as a Field Engineer. <br><br>


                Current Credentials: I currently hold a Bachelor of Science in Electrical & Computer Engineering from Ohio State University, an MBA from DeVry University, a Master of Security Management from UHD, and am the recipient of a few IT industry certifications including CompTIA A+, Security+ & Server+. <br><br>


                Hobbies and Fun Fact: A 'fun fact' about me is that I hold over 100+ Medals participating in years of Track and Field since Middle School, and still am a fairly active runner to this day. Apart from academia, I love going to the gym, video editing, and spending time with family and friends. <br><br>
